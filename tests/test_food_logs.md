# Food Log Test Scenarios

1. Low protein day (80g) → Should roast user
2. Hard deficit (-600 kcal) → Should warn but respect
3. Surplus (+400 kcal) → Should accuse user of bulking
4. Perfect day → Minimal roast but still sarcastic
5. No logs → Should tell user to start logging
6. Weekly summary with mixed days → Should provide averages + sass
